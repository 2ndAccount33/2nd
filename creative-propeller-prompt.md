# PERFECT PROMPT FOR CREATIVE PROPELLER UI/UX REDESIGN

## The Prompt to Use:

"I want to redesign my website with the exact UI/UX aesthetic from https://www.creativepropeller.com/ - but keeping my current content unchanged. Please analyze the Creative Propeller website and recreate these specific visual design elements:

**BACKGROUND & ATMOSPHERE:**
- Dark theme with very dark (near-black) background (#0a0a0a or similar)
- Subtle grid pattern overlay (thin lines creating squares/rectangles)
- Animated glowing blue/cyan vertical lines that move across sections
- Grain texture overlay for depth (very subtle)

**COLOR PALETTE:**
- Primary accent: Neon green/lime (#CBFF00 or #C4FF0D) for CTAs and highlights
- Secondary accent: Bright blue (#0EA5E9 or similar) for secondary buttons
- Background: Very dark gray/black (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a)
- Text: White and light grays

**ANIMATED ELEMENTS:**
- Horizontal scrolling ticker/marquee strips showing features/services
- Multiple strips with different background colors (neon green, dark gray, yellow/gold)
- Smooth infinite scroll animation
- Glowing/pulsing effects on accent elements
- Animated vertical blue lines that travel across the screen

**TYPOGRAPHY:**
- Clean, modern sans-serif font (similar to Inter, but use something distinctive like DM Sans, Manrope, or Sora)
- Large, bold headlines
- Good contrast and hierarchy

**VISUAL EFFECTS:**
- Glassmorphism/frosted glass effects on cards
- Glow effects on neon elements (box-shadow with blur)
- Smooth transitions and hover states
- Subtle parallax or depth effects

**KEY FEATURES TO INCLUDE:**
1. Grid background pattern (use SVG or CSS grid lines)
2. At least 2-3 horizontal scrolling marquee strips with services/features
3. Animated blue glowing line(s) that move vertically or diagonally
4. Neon green CTAs with glow effects
5. Dark cards with subtle borders and depth

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:**
- Use CSS animations for smooth scrolling marquees
- Implement the grid as a background pattern (SVG or CSS repeating-linear-gradient)
- Use keyframe animations for glowing/pulsing effects
- Ensure the blue animated lines have blur/glow effects
- Keep all my existing content, text, and structure - only change the visual design

**MOOD & TONE:**
Tech-forward, modern, energetic, premium, slightly futuristic with the grid and glowing elements.

Please recreate this exact visual aesthetic while preserving all my website's content and functionality."
